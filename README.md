# PogoGen

## Why?
If you're using [PokemonGo-Bot](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot/) 
to level multiple accounts, you might have noticed that the `dev` branch
changes quite often the structure of the configuration files.

Now I've made this to update my files easily when the structure changed.
